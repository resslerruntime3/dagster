# Using Dagster with Airflow

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/with_airflow" />

The [`dagster-airflow`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-airflow) package provides interoperability between Dagster and Airflow. The main scenarios for using the Dagster Airflow integration are:

- You want to do a lift-and-shift migration of all your existing Airflow Dags into Dagster
- You want to run Dagster Jobs on your existing Airflow Infrastructure
- You want to orchestrate Dagster JobRuns from Airflow

This integration is designed to help support users who have existing Airflow usage and are looking to explore using Dagster.
